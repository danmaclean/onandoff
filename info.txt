As I took this some native ran up to me, exclaiming thus, "Hey buddy, why are you shooting that?" Turns out this gentleman was a photographer for the paper and having passed that way each day for 20 yrs had never thought to shoot the same thing. Having discussed why and he having determined my nationality he quipped "Hey, we Won!". Naturally I was confused, but after a moment's pause I began to protest, the recent match after all had been a draw and then a very one-sided draw that came about only because of a bit of a whoopsie moment. Before I could get my words out, he clarified "The war!". Joy, I thought, at last those eastern conflicts over, "We did?" exclaimed I. This time he looked confused, "No man, the revolution!". It was all I could do to sputter, some apology for not getting the joke (it was either that or laugh at him). Seeing that I didn't find his gag funny, he apologised for its tastlessness, I apologised again for not understanding.

Our hosts were very keen not to let us out of their sight, ferrying us from pillar to post and not letting us out anywhere near the streets, thus a great deal of these shots were taken from within a moving bus!
i like ehow there's an echo of the pink bag.

images/1227730362.jpg;|;camera dolorosa I;|;2008-11-26;|;camera dolorosa 1I spent some time debating whether or not to post this fairly lengthy series. Its a new style for me and not one that seems to be very prevalent. The pictures are deliberately not-beautiful and I know that this style isnt going to be to everyones taste. Thats why I chose not to use the toy cameras or the digital, I didnt want to add any of the accent provided by plastic lens or be tempted by the decadent touches of digital processing. They were all taken to be seen plain soldier, and display a combination of my eye and a camera capable of extraordinary visual fidelity. Unless you are me you run the risk of not getting it, but I know that I love them. And I dont think you can be more truthful about how you see the world than that. Leica M4, Fuji Superia 400

Thanks for continuing to stop by, I will return visits very soon. Holga 120 CFN Rollei Retro 100 I had this done down the chemist instead of developing it myself, I sort of wish I hadnt been so lazy.. the negs came back all warped and too grainy for this film, bah!

yes. love the handling of the light & works so well in black and white. ooh. just noticed. is that a warp in time and space or just fingerprints on the negative??  trotsky @ 2008-11-04 23:34:20THanks muchly. Im sad to say that warping is where the photo lab messed up the neg a bit. its more evident than when I do it myself.. ALthough if it were a warp in the fabric of time and space it would be a really great shot.

The sunlight has a wonderful watery quality, warm but not harsh. Forgive me for pointing this out but it is just like the winter light in the North of England that is just subtly different from that further south. Like sunlight lite.
images/1220474496.jpg;|;Port of Gothenburg III;|;2008-09-03;|;In the first post of this Gothenburg series, James at LWS summed up the city beautifully as quiet. And thats exactly what Gothenburg is, a quietly confident city seemingly at peace with itself. Its no Vienna or Barcelona, not a stunning place architecturally or culturally but it does have a wonderful feel, its really great to just sit around there. Ive been thinking about why I do this blog recently, onandoff started as just a place to show my best pictures, but its been mutating towards something similar to what I did with my previous, now long gone blog, nonemorebeige. Ive decided Im going to let onandoff slide in that direction. There isnt any point in fighting it really. The good pictures will have to go elsewhere. So, on the left we see the Stadsteatern in Goteborg.

Due in no small part to my recent health. I have had shingles! A disease more commonly associated with the Middle Ages., I feel. The disease caused my left eye to become inflamed and I have not had much vision for a week, so naturally blogging, particularly photoblogging was out . My eyesight has improved enough to allow me to type but not to appreciate any photos properly, so forgive me if it takes me a little while to get round to answering the very kind responses I got to the a day at the seaside series and to checking out your sites again.  So in the interim I post this, a shot taken at the same stretch of coast as the preceding Holga series but with a different camera and film. Frequent readers of this spot will know I have been having problems with the 80mm lens on my Mamiya, and for this expedition I replaced it with one of the longer ones in the kit. But as if to make my efforts doubly hard, fate decided that the film would unwind itself from the spool after I took it out of the foil wrapping and before I loaded it. Madre de Dios! Although I feared the whole roll would be exposed I decided to shoot it anyway. I got a couple of shots of that shingle beach, although the vision is somewhat impaired.... On the plus side I have managed to fix the problem with the 80mm lens using not much more than a rubber band! I hope my own eyes are as easy to fix
shingles in your Eyes! Poor you.  jeremy @ 2008-05-06 23:34:20Ack. I dont Ive ever known anyone with shingles. Quick recovery, Dan.

The discreet label shouts so many contrasts; an advert to get your attention yet tiny. A prize every time, yet play till you win, small toys and high hopes. How could one pass by without sensing the exasperation of someone who fills and manages this machine, not brave enough to admit outright they really just want your money so promise a fair exchange in contradiction of the palpable truth. The small investment in the machine an indication that the manager is learned enough in their way to know that this doesnt make much money yet in theory it should, so it might this time. So much old England, so sea-side.

Id like to wax lyrical about the glorious decay and wonderful end of everything, breathing out a last breath feeling but Sheringham is so small I doubted if it was ever really significantly different to how it is now. So some photos of a typical English sea-side town!

This one is seriously good. Youve captured the texture of the petals nicely, and the conversion is sympathetic to the subject.

images/1207430644.jpg;|;a plate fungus;|;2008-04-05;|;Holga 120 CFN, Rollei Retro 100 developed in Rodinal 1:50 (as per OttoKs protocol! ), Cloudy Aperture Setting ~f 8) Abandoning the experimental digital flower shots that have gone down so well (!) I present the major achievement of my most recent experiment (why is this site all about recording the results of experiments lately..?). The picture above is from the first roll (alright second, but the first really was a test) that I developed myself. This minor achievement has been made possible by the beneficent nature of OttoK over at Lenscape, who was kind enough to share with me his protocol for developing his B+W film. I think it all went well! Im certainly not as good as Otto yet, but Ill get there.. or at least some of the way there! So as thanks for his help Id like to dedicate this post to Otto, cheers to him! The shot itself depicts a plate fungus growing on a tree stump in the fen-like swamp on my way to work, I hope that youll enjoy the following short series on the same subject, if you arent keen please let me know why too. The choice of subject matter has a pretty definite inspiration, see ... Im not joking, this really was what went through my head when I was planning this shot.
Well, cool. You really have a nice sharp focus point. So how was development process? Did you have fun? Otto K. @ 2008-04-06 23:34:20I like the outcome here. Its nicely composed and sharp, if a little overexposed. The best part for me is that someone is experiencing a positive experience for the expressions community, which seems to be rather dead at the moment. theres hope for the old girl yet:) pete @ 2008-04-06 23:34:20Interesting effect...I kind of like how the overexposed light seems to wash over the forest scene. James @ 2008-04-07 23:34:20great - also liked watching the video!! moonhead @ 2008-04-07 23:34:20A fantastic light!    Still @ 2008-04-11 23:34:20

This is really cool. You need to add a Polaroid into the mix. :) Otto K. @ 2008-02-04 23:34:20Tena koe ehoa They all have wonderful individual characteristics but put them beside one another and the collective individuality becomes a lot more interesting in a comparative sense.

So here it is. This is a composite of the four shots of a tree and path near to where I work on a bright Saturday morning in mid January. It was very cold. Reading from top left to bottom right the camera used was Mamiya C330, Nikon D50, Diana F and Holga 120 CFN. These small pictures arent satisfactory so if you use the previous picture button on the site youll see a bigger version of the shots in sequence.

images/1193515425.jpg;|;Failure, Manchester University;|;2007-10-27;|;After the short holga series, here is another short series of some shots taken with my other recent acquisition, a 50 mm lens. Taken in Manchester earlier this week, it was at Manchester University that I did my undergrad and masters. The man here is reading a book called Molecular Biology of the Cell, by Alberts et al. The cornerstone text of my undergraduate days. Those student days were turbulent, for the wrong reasons often and Im not sad to see the back of them, so when I saw this cold and bothered looking guy through the window reading that tome I was compelled to try and illustrate the mood and the memory. The picture gets its name because none of that is actually in the picture and I had to describe it.
I like the shot, its very capture the moment and works well due to the lighting. But youre right -he could be reading a newspaper, or the latest copy of nuts - so its a miss on the mood capture. Have fun with your 50mm, f1.8 makes for great portraits (staged or not) pete @ 2007-10-28 23:34:20That you survived is all that matters...What doesnt kill us, makes us stronger. I am going to respectfully disagree with pete in that I think that because the mans body language is so intense, you have perfectly captured the turbulent mood of your undergrad memories. This is beautiful work. The subject, the tones, the clarity, and the myriad of reflections combine to make a perfectly moody street shot. Well done! marci @ 2007-10-29 23:34:20Nice one...I like the angle at which you shot this plus the mans expression is intense ChaCha @ 2007-10-29 23:34:20very nice indeed. louise @ 2007-11-06 23:34:20I love this one. you played very well with the reflections.. they give such an atmosphere to this image.     nissou* @ 2007-11-21 23:34:20generic pills online

images/1193084778.jpg;|;telegraph poles;|;2007-10-22;|;A curious image with which to continue. A scan of a film shot. Curious indeed since this blog is called on and off, a nod to the digital nature of the photos as well as the entirely inconsistent timetable of photographing and posting. Recent gaps in service have been caused by me spending my time learning how to use two new acquisitions, one of which was a Holga. Out here in the wild, wild woods of East Anglia, getting prints from 120 film is shockingly difficult, factor in the idiosyncracies of the Holga and you have a long wait for results. Still patience is a bitter vine that bears sweet fruit and Im starting to see some reward. Here is a shot from the three worth printing from my second roll. Not a dreadful hit rate, I think! I just had to get over mis-handling the first roll by allowing far too much light onto it (rendering the negative virtually entirely green), and also not setting the thing up correctly and exposing overlapping frames. Still, one lives to learn. So what do I think, I who seemingly so firmly nailed my colours to the mast with the blog name? I think I have a new friend. Expect to see more of these shots up here in the future... on and off, anyway.
nice holga...extreme vignetting, light leak...this has got the lot! trotsky @ 2007-10-22 23:34:20Cool one. As Trots said, serious vignetting...nice. :) Looking forward to more.    Otto K. @ 2007-10-23 23:34:20

Designed in the 1960s it has a certain face designed to look like Ziggurat pyramids. Fascinatingly ugly.
This is a strong and effective picture. The golden glow across the front of the building is in nice contrast to the glowering clouds above. The building itself is almost irrelevant in comparison with the mood. Well done. Jack @ 2007-07-11 23:34:20Tena koe ehoa Im not sure Id say fascinatingly ugly, perhaps just ugly? You know the history of architectural design is filled with such anomolys. I like the way youve used the architectural form to contrast the natural random fluidity of nature. Im sure somewhere in the capturing/post production of this image youre making a comparison of form? ndiginiz @ 2007-07-11 23:34:20In a perverse way I love 60s buildings. This is no exception. A good capture, the variable light across the building help to define it against the cloud. Almost as thought the structure is glowing. Nice shot of a (sort of) nasty thing Pete @ 2007-07-11 23:34:20I love your phrase, "fascinatingly ugly." I think it perfectly sums up the architecture from the 60s right through the late 90s. The heavy clouds and dark undertones of this photo help to create a gloomy mood, but the golden tones offer some hope. Excellent processing of an interesting subject.  marci @ 2007-07-13 23:34:20this is brilliant - composition and light are amazing. and the way you captured it makes it likeable in its ugliness. louise @ 2007-07-14 23:34:20Fascinatingly ugly. But when you capture it this well, it has a certain charm and appeal. I have to say, I like it. If every day in Norwich was this apocalyptic then the building would be much more appreciated. LwS @ 2007-07-18 23:34:20youve summed it up perfectly yourself: fascinatingly ugly it certainly is! but from that youve sculpted a great shot - the light here is wonderful/ david @ 2007-07-18 23:34:20very dramatic.... almost has the look of ancient ruins. well done    pieter @ 2007-07-29 23:34:20

Id just like to see the criss-cross pattern extended more beyond the top of the frame I think it would adda sense of curvture as well.

Both shots are so peaceful and beautiful, with perfect tones. In the Hyde Park shot, I love the shadows across the ground from the trees and the center line drawing me into the photo.     marci @ 2007-03-25 23:34:20
